# Credit_Risk_Analysis

# Overview

  The purpose of the analysis was to create a supervised machine learning model that could predict credit risk. To complete this analysis, 6 different methods were used:
   1. Naive Random Oversampling
   2. SMOTE Oversampling
   3. Cluster Centroid Undersampling
   4. SMOTEENN Sampling
   5. Balanced Random Forest Classifying
   6. Easy Ensemble Classifying
  
  After going through each one of these methods, the results of the data were split into fields:
   - Training / testing datasets
   - accuracy scores
